### **Introduction**
*"Thank you for this opportunity. Let me present **StockXplorer**, a stock market analysis tool designed to help users analyze historical trends, predict future prices, and track real-time market data. The goal was to create a user-friendly dashboard that bridges the gap between complex financial data and actionable insights."*

### **Pipeline Explanation**
1. **Problem Statement:**
   - "Stock market data is highly volatile and challenging to predict. Existing tools often lack seamless integration of historical and live data with advanced predictive modeling."
   - "To address this, I developed StockXplorer—a tool that simplifies data analysis, enhances prediction accuracy, and provides real-time market updates."

2. **Data Collection:**
   - "The data pipeline starts with input from two sources:
      - Historical data: Uploaded as CSV files containing columns like Date, Open, Close, etc.
      - Real-time data: Fetched dynamically using APIs like Alpha Vantage."

3. **Data Preprocessing:**
   - "Data is cleaned to handle missing values, dates are formatted correctly, and key features like moving averages (SMA, EMA) are engineered for analysis."

4. **Modeling:**
   - "I implemented three models:
      - **ARIMA:** For trend-based forecasting of non-seasonal data.
      - **SARIMA:** To capture seasonality in stock trends.
      - **LSTM:** A deep learning model for handling complex, time-dependent relationships in stock data."
   - "Each model’s performance is evaluated using RMSE to ensure accuracy."

5. **Visualization:**
   - "The dashboard uses interactive line charts and heatmaps for effective data visualization, making it easy for users to explore trends and correlations."

6. **Real-Time Integration:**
   - "Using live stock tickers, the tool fetches real-time prices, dynamically updates trends, and predicts future stock prices."

7. **Deployment:**
   - "The entire system is deployed using **Streamlit**, making it accessible as a web application for both technical and non-technical users."
